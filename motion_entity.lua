--[[
Minetest doesn't currently allow manipulation of the player's velocity;
currently the client is mostly responsible for determining player speed (!!),
and the server is unable to report events that would affect the player's velocity;
this means that we e.g. can't throw the player up into the air.

This makes portals a bit boring, as we can't execute fling motions on the player.
However, consider the following:
when a player would be moving really fast in mid-air,
realistically the player shouldn't be able to magically mid-air strafe
(they've got nothing to push on).
Therefore, it doesn't matter if we lock the player's controls and do the motion for them.

The best way to do this is to attach them to an invisible entity.
This entity *can* be flung around, so we just manipulate that;
e.g. when the portal warps a player moving at speed,
stick them on this "motion entity" and use that to control their velocity.
When the player's speed has returned to within normal range
(e.g. how fast they could normally walk - usually about 2m/s),
the entity detaches the player and removes itself.
